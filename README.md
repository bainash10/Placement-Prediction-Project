# Logistic Regression for Placement Prediction 📈

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression to predict placement outcomes based on features such as CGPA and IQ scores. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a student will be placed or not based on their attributes. 🎯

## Steps

### 1. Preprocessing + EDA + Feature Selection 🧹

- **Load Data:** Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and select relevant features. 📊
- **Feature Selection:** Choose input and output columns for the model. 🔍

### 2. Extract Input and Output Columns 🔄

- Extract the features (X) and target variable (Y) from the dataset. 📋

### 3. Scale the Values 📏

- Normalize feature values to ensure better performance and convergence of the model. 🚀

### 4. Train-Test Split 🔀

- Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. 🧪

### 5. Train the Model 🛠️

- Implement and train the logistic regression model on the training data. 🎓

### 6. Evaluate the Model 📈

- Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy. 🏅
- Visualize the decision boundaries to understand model behavior. 🖼️
